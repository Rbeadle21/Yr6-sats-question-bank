If circles = 25, then 2n + 1 = 25, so 2n = 24, therefore n = 12. Wait, checking: Pattern 1 has 1 square and 3 circles, Pattern 2 has 2 squares and 5 circles. Formula: circles = 2×squares + 1. If circles = 25, then 25 = 2×squares + 1, so 24 = 2×squares, therefore squares = 12. Actually 11: if pattern continues, number of circles = 2n+1 where n is pattern number which equals number of squares. 2(11)+1=23, 2(12)+1=25. So 12 squares gives 25 circles.

Show your working. You may get a mark. Nika and Hassan bought some bags of apples. Nika says, 'I bought more apples than Hassan, but I spent less money.' Explain how this is possible.",
      "answer": "18a: 2 bags of green apples and 3 bags of red apples (Green: 2 × 75p = £1.50, Red: 3 × 90p = £2.70, Total: £1.50 + £2.70 = £4.20), 18b: Green apples cost 12.5p each (75p ÷ 6), red apples cost 9p each (90p ÷ 10). Since green apples cost more per apple, Nika could buy more bags of red apples (more total apples) but spend less money than Hassan who bought bags of the more expensive green apples. For example: Nika buys 2 bags of red (20 apples, £1.80), Hassan buys 2 bags of green (12 apples, £1.50) - wait, that doesn't work. Actually: Nika buys 3 bags of red (30 apples for £2.70), Hassan buys 4 bags of green (24 apples for £3.00). Nika has more apples (30 > 24) but spent less (£2.70 < £3.00).",

      "question": "Sarah had a bag of cherries. She ate 5 cherries, then gave half of what she had left to Liam. Liam ate 5 of his cherries, then gave half of what he had left to Amy. Amy got 2 cherries. How many cherries did Sarah have in her bag at the start?",
      "answer": "23 cherries. Working backwards: Amy got 2, which was half of what Liam had after eating 5. So Liam had 2 × 2 = 4 after eating 5, meaning he received 4 + 5 = 9 from Sarah. This 9 was half of what Sarah had after eating 5, so Sarah had 9 × 2 = 18 after eating 5. Therefore Sarah started with 18 + 5 = 23 cherries. Check: Sarah starts with 23, eats 5 → 18 left. Gives half (9) to Liam. Liam has 9, eats 5 → 4 left. Gives half (2) to Amy ✓",

      "question": "Here are five number cards: 48, 49, 50, 51, 52. Use each card once to make every statement below correct. [?] is a multiple of 3. [?] is a multiple of 4. [?] is a multiple of 5. [?] is a multiple of 6. [?] is a multiple of 7.",
      "answer": "48 is a multiple of 3 (48÷3=16), 48 is a multiple of 4 (48÷4=12), 50 is a multiple of 5 (50÷5=10), 48 is a multiple of 6 (48÷6=8), 49 is a multiple of 7 (49÷7=7). Wait, 48 can't be used three times. Correct answer: 51 is a multiple of 3, 48 is a multiple of 4, 50 is a multiple of 5, 48 is a multiple of 6... This is impossible with each card used once. Let me recalculate: 48 (mult of 3,4,6), 49 (mult of 7), 50 (mult of 5), 51 (mult of 3), 52 (mult of 4). Since 48 is multiple of both 3 and 6, use: 51 for 3, 48 for 4, 50 for 5, 48 for 6... Still impossible. Correct solution: 48 is mult of 6, 49 is mult of 7, 50 is mult of 5, 51 is mult of 3, 52 is mult of 4.",

      "answer": "17a: 160°, 17b: 20°. Working: Triangle angles sum to 180°. If a=160° and c=35° (vertical angles), then b = 180° - 160° - 35° = -15° is wrong. Actually: angle a is at top of triangle. The 35° angle and angle c are vertically opposite. In the triangle: a + b + 35° = 180°. Also shown: a straight line has angles that sum to 180°. One angle is 160°, so the adjacent angle = 180° - 160° = 20°. This 20° angle and angle b are vertically opposite, so b = 20°. Therefore a = 180° - 35° - 20° = 125°. Let me recalculate: The marking scheme says 17a: 160, 17b: 20. From the image description, a is marked as one angle, c is marked as 35°. Since a=160° is the answer, and the triangle has angles a, b, and c where c=35°, we have a + b + c = 180°, so 160° + b + 35° = 195° which is wrong. The angles must be exterior/interior. Actually, looking at official answer: a=160° is EXTERIOR to the triangle, and interior angle at that vertex = 180°-160°=20°. The triangle has interior angles: 20°, b, and 35°. So 20° + b + 35° = 180°, giving b = 125°. But official says b=20°. Let me check if a and b are related differently. If both a and b are marked on the diagram in specific positions, and official says a=160° and b=20°, and notes 'if incorrect, award 1 mark if a+b=180°', this means a and b are supplementary angles. So a=160°, b=20°, and 160°+20°=180°. In the triangle context, one angle is 35°, and the other two angles are likely the supplements of a and b, which would be 20° and 160°. But 20°+160°+35°=215° ≠ 180°. The marking scheme states clearly: 17a=160, 17b=20. I'll use the official answers.",

      "question": "Clock shows time twice a day. Tick two digital clocks",
      "answer": "Both clocks showing 02:45 and 14:45 should be ticked. The question asks to identify which clocks show times that are 7 hours apart. 02:45 (2:45 AM) and 09:45 (9:45 AM) are 7 hours apart. 14:45 (2:45 PM) and 21:45 (9:45 PM) are 7 hours apart. However, the official marking scheme shows that 02:45 and 14:45 are the two clocks that should be ticked. These are actually 12 hours apart, not 7 hours apart. Let me re-read the question from the image description. The question states: 'Each clock below shows the time in am or pm.' Looking at the marking scheme page 22, question 3 shows two clocks ticked with checkmarks, and the requirement is 'Both clocks ticked as shown: 03:45, 02:45, 09:45, with checkmark on one, then 21:45, 14:45, with checkmark on the other.' Wait, looking more carefully, the first row shows: 03:45, 02:45, 09:45, and the middle clock (02:45) has a tick. The second row shows: 21:45, 14:45, and the right clock (14:45) has a tick. So the two clocks ticked are 02:45 and 14:45. That's 12 hours apart. But maybe the question is asking something different. Let me check the official answer on page 22: 'Both clocks ticked, as shown: 03:45  02:45  09:45 [checkmark on 02:45], 21:45  14:45 [checkmark on 14:45]'. Mark: 1m. So the answer is: 02:45 and 14:45 are ticked.",
